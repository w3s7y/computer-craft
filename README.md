# computer-craft
Some chill crafting and coding!

# Bens Learning de lua 
* coroutines (threading) needed for listening to our PDAs and also doing their job at same time 
* wtf is going on with local (it's an interpreter thang)
* 


# Ideas
Some basic ideas that we can try?

## Static machine projects
* GPS Servers (need to do this for turtles anyway)
* Storage Monitors (hook into main storage and query it)
* Dynamic map generation (move, query surroundings, log & repeat.  then return to base (RTB) and continue)
* A piano (pressure plates and redstone into computers to play notes)
* Building alarms (tripwires / redstone circuits feeding into alerts on our PDAs)

## Turtles
* Miners
  * Strip mines (needed? the turtle can x-ray the good blocks)
  * X-Ray mining 
  * Go Get (block type) and return to me script
  * Just... fkin mine the lot (set an area to delete)
    * Possibility for many turtles to share info over rednet and tell each other where they mine.
    * so they don't try to mine over already cleared areas? 
* Builders
  * Bridges 
  * towers
  * holes (basically a tower miner not a builder!)
* Feeders n breeders 
  * Feed the animals on a loop
  * Give the villagers trades to up their level / lower cost
  * Auto-trading off our PDAs remotely?  We could do a trade and get the item delivered by turtle?
* Fighters!
  * Give em swords, set em to stay within X blocks of ya
  * And go attack any hostile mob within Y blocks of ya 
* Tree Growers
  * Saplings, dirt & bonemeal & an area 
* "The turtle ship" - a flying boat powered by turtles 
  * Build a slime ship and see if turtles can push the blocks 
    * Wait... a FLYING CITY!
